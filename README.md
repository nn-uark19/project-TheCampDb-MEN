---------------
Note: 
- (git) if we make a change in branch2, but not stage/commit, you will lose all the changes if you switch to other branches
- (mongoose) Cat.find returns array, whereas Cat.findById return 1 object
- (git) fastforward. seems like the master branch got fast forward due to no changes between merges.
